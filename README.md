# order-summary-card
A responsive webpage displaying the order summary of a music plan.
The aim of the project was to learn how to develop around a design. I wanted to learn how to code in steps.
I only used HTML and CSS.

For responsiveness:
Media queries.

For positioning(most frequently used):
Margin: 0 auto;

I learnt more about psuedo codes and how to use them while on this project.
